            <p>
              We look to provide a new more efficient way of producing gas and
              liquid fuel from waste products to power adapted generators.
              Household food waste, paper packaging, plastics, Industrial waste
              after selection, Bio waste, Wood, Straw, Tyres, Agri manure and
              many more can be used as input fuel.

              We continuingly research and develop on all aspects of energy
              improvement utilising advanced computer processing facilities, on
              campus graduates & satellite test centres. We strive to replace
              all bio digesters & other incinerator equipment & enable refit of
              all generator stations with a clean sustainable system.

            Our first site was to be developed for Northern Ireland but received
            no support and was moved overseas, to take the benefit of an
            installation that was being developed by one of our associated
            engineers. This site is now producing 110 mega watt of sustainable
            energy with no emissions other than usable ash. Its designer is now
            working with us to build further sites in Ireland, UK and the
            Commonwealth Countries.

            Power House Innovations Ltd. (PHI) has an office on West Campus
            Waterford supported by WIT with the availability of the best
            research and communications facilities in the country. There is also
            trained management available to solve any problem that arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Power House Innovations Ltd. also has among its directors
            experienced technical expertise of onsite design and building
            construction in Ireland and the UK and a director who has installed
            generators and UPS systems in many hospitals, call centres,
            education computer centres and protects large parts of government
            services like the HSE and defence installations from power
            disturbance with back-up systems. He has also built and installed
            systems in many countries around the world. One of his long time
            partners in these installations is a large generator builder and
            service company in Doncaster,

          <p>
            The equipment PHI is to assemble and market in Ireland UK and
            Commonwealth Countries is a new more efficient way of producing gas
            and liquid fuel from waste products to power adapted generators.
            Household food waste, paper packaging, plastics, Industrial waste
            after selection, Bio waste, Wood, Straw, Tyres, Agri manure and many
            more can be used as input fuel.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have the facilities and expert staff to install this with
            generators and CHP facilities with the view to full manufacture and
            installation in Europe. This PAR technology has operated fault free
            on our overseas site for many years. PAR systems are now operational
            at a site which generates in excess of 100MW of power per hour. This
            power plant has a long term plan to install additional PAR units in
            order to convert from a fossil fuel station to a fully renewable
            power plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            We propose to establish a depot in the Waterford area where we can
            connect to the national grid to help disperse this project to all
            parts of the country but any one acre covered site in the country
            could avail of our initial assembly and preinstall test centre
            provided it had a link to the national grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are prepared to work with any group to establish sites and
            facilities for this new technology as it will change the sustainable
            energy program in Ireland, UK and Europe by replacing all bio
            digesters and other incinerator equipment and enable refit of all
            generator stations with this modern technology that is a clean
            sustainable system.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have had conversations with the wind turbine group and agreed
            this would be a helpful addition to their facilities and they are
            prepared to purchase when we are operational: possible 20 sites. We
            have a well progressed poultry litter base fuel site in N. Ireland
            awaiting DARD approval. A site for refitting in Newry awaiting
            decisions. A site in Strabane which had planning permission to be
            commenced and a number of sites in the UK, systems of funding
            pending.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will continue our research and development in Waterford on all
            aspects of energy improvement utilising the advanced computer
            processing facilities and young graduates in several fields on our
            campus and satellite test centres worldwide.

            if you wish to help in any way to progress this future advance in
            clean energy and safe disposal of energy rich waste by directing us
            to potential sites in your locality. Remembering our system will not
            produce emissions as present day sites do and with several
            throughout the country no need for unsightly pylons.
