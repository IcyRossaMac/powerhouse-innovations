        <div class="content">
          <p>
              The Pyrolysis Airless Reactor (PAR) system is equipment that can produce oil and gas from most carbon materials without the harmful emissions of other heat-based systems. It is a clear improvement on all incinerators, gasifier, bio and anaerobic digesters as it can produce fuels at a greatly higher calorific value, at lower costs. It eliminates the smells and emissions through its patented systems to only release oxygen to the atmosphere and low amounts of ash which, in most cases, can be used for other things.
          </p>
          <p>
              The PAR system a large advancement in the use of all carbon-based waste like end-of-life tyres, plastic containers, paper, cardboard, wood waste and many household or shop waste products, including food waste. The waste from the farms like cattle manure poultry litter bedding straw with manure and all agri slurry leaving a concentrated ash that can be diluted by waste water to act as a high nutrient fertilizer, with lower volumes and transport costs thus increasing its value multifold.
          </p>
          <p>
              It can use straw and the complete rapeseed plant, willow, forestry cuttings saw dust producing a large profit for farms over and above present day prices. It also operates efficiently with low sulfur coal and waste oils producing gas and liquid fuels equal to natural gas and standard diesel.
          </p>
          <p>
              A process of low heat 270°C to 290°C can be used for torrefaction of input fuels which is a method of producing high calorific pellets or cubes that can be used in the PAR at a later date to produce high grade fuel. These fuel can be used in our adapted generators to produce power in the form of electricity, steam, heat, and cooling systems through our new heat exchanger systems.
          </p>
          <p>
              We also have new systems of heat and exhaust capture to remove emissions and produce further power from all sites low sulphar coal and end of life tyres will produce approx 38,000 liters of oil per daywith calorific values of 145,000btu/usa gallon Biomass products 100% nitrogen free synthetic gas from 7000 to 60,000 cubic feet per hour operating at 2 ton per hour fuel input.
          </p>
          <p>
              Plastic feedstocks have high value at 980 liters of low sulfur oil per metric ton. This new approach to emission free fuel and power production will be used to refit power stations replace incinerators and bio digesters as they only need 50 ton per day of any of the previously noted input fuels to produce 2 to 5-megawatts of power.
          </p>
          <p>
              Local authorities will use them as waste disposal systems reducing the cost to have sewerage treatment plants and land fill sites. Farmers can control their waste and power their own and neighbours farms while producing high return crops for own or local use and power production.
          </p>
          <p>
              All countries can remove the need for costly infrastructure of unsightly pylons and large coal burning generator stations and build small generator stations with high clean output including constant backup for solar and wind power to further reduce the infrastructure costs and the price of power.
          </p>
          <p>
              We are looking for sites worldwide with grid connections or constant consumer users to install our PAR systems and will point our investors to each site to take the startup costs from 2 megawatt upwards. This PAR technology has operated fault free on our overseas site for many years. PAR systems are now operational at a site which generates in excess of 100MW of power per hour.  This power plant has a long term plan to install additional PAR units in order to convert from a fossil fuel station to a fully renewable power plant.
          </p>
          <p>
              Two mega watts of electric power at domestic rates £0.17 per kwh for 8760 per year is £2,978,400.
          </p>
          <p>
              Similar to sustainable energy prices or 2 rocs in the UK. Small investments of £250,000 max 20 investors starting with 2 megawatt sites for a cost of £5,000,000 would give a very large return. Two megawatt of power from every two ton of selected waste secured on the capital equipment (minimum expected life 10 years) and the site value.
